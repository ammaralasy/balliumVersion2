Despite the war, my dream was like a hard adventure in a really difficult time we were forced to prove ourselves with determination. It was my wish that pushing me to the first step into the road of striving,but determination is the thing kept me on the right path till the end and this is what I did until it changed to Balloon. Always and repeatedly heard that war destroy dreams and homes ,but it was an inspiration to be strong and better. My career with a design for one of my buddies then  lots of orders comes. The balloon kept nourishing till it turns into Ballium. This name started spread among people. As a balloon it raised to the sky to see the light to get merged.
